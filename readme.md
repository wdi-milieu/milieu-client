Milieu Client Dashboard

Milieu's real time consumer perception dashboard provides a steady stream of insights to brands, agencies and even government agencies to understand what consumers what and feel. It allows brands to react in real time to marketing campaigns, new product launches and pr events or crisis.

Milieu dashboard consumes a aggregated data API from our survey platform in real time. Dashboards can be customized to be relevant for the client. In this example, we layout key information that provides a pulse to consumer's perception and loyalty to brands via:

1) Net Promoter Score tracking
2) Providing an indication of reasons for NPS score.
3) Twitter Sentiments

Twitter Sentiments is an external API from a group member's brother. It measure the number of positive and negative words in the last 30 tweets. Its a running pulse that provides an indication of what people are saying about brands.

Our objective is to also provide aggregated APIs that allow clients to attach to their sales or performance dashboards to provide an additional dimension for analysis.
